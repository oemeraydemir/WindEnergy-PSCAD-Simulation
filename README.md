#  WinterBind Project – Load Calculation and Electrical Power Relationship

## 1. Introduction

In the WinterBind project, wind energy is first converted into mechanical energy and then transformed into electrical energy using a synchronous machine. A portion of the generated power is consumed by a purely resistive load connected to the system. This document details how the load value is calculated and how electrical power equations are applied in this context.

## 2. Electrical Power Equation

In three-phase electrical systems, the active power is expressed as:

$$
P = 3 \cdot V_{\text{rms}} \cdot I_{\text{rms}} \cdot \cos(\phi)
$$

Where:
- $ P $: Active power (Watts)
- $ V_{\text{rms}} $: Phase-to-neutral voltage (Volts)
- $ I_{\text{rms}} $: Phase current (Amperes)
- $ \cos(\phi) $: Power factor (assumed to be 1 for resistive load)

This equation models the electrical power generated by the synchronous generator in the WinterBind system. However, our main objective is to determine the appropriate **resistive load value** that will consume this power. Therefore, we reformulate this expression using Ohm's law.

## 3. Resistive Load Calculation

Power dissipated by a resistive load can also be expressed as:

$$
P = 3 \cdot I^2 \cdot R
$$

Or, in terms of voltage and impedance:

$$
P = \frac{3 \cdot V^2 \cdot R}{R^2 + X_d^2}
$$

Where:
- $ R $: Load resistance (Ω)
- $ X_d $: Synchronous reactance (Ω or p.u.)
- $ V $: Phase voltage (Volts)

###  Given Parameters:

| Parameter                | Value          |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Rated Voltage (L-L)      | 0.4 kV (400 V) |
| Rated Power              | 2 MW           |
| Synchronous Reactance    | 0.5 p.u.       |
| Power Factor ($\cos(\phi)$) | 1              |

#### ➤ Phase Voltage:
$$
V_{ph} = \frac{400}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 230.94 \, \text{V}
$$

#### ➤ Phase Current:
$$
I = \frac{P}{\sqrt{3} \cdot V_{LL} \cdot \cos(\phi)} = \frac{2 \times 10^6}{\sqrt{3} \cdot 400 \cdot 1} \approx 2887 \, \text{A}
$$

#### ➤ Load Resistance (Ideal Case):
$$
R = \frac{V_{ph}}{I} = \frac{230.94}{2887} \approx 0.08 \, \Omega
$$

This value assumes a purely resistive scenario. In reality, we must also consider the synchronous reactance of the machine.

###  Including Reactance Effect

To factor in the machine’s internal impedance:

#### ➤ Base Impedance:
$$
Z_{\text{base}} = \frac{V_{LL}^2}{S_{\text{rated}}} = \frac{(400)^2}{2 \times 10^6} = 0.08 \, \Omega
$$

#### ➤ Synchronous Reactance in Ohms:
$$
X_d = 0.5 \cdot Z_{\text{base}} = 0.5 \cdot 0.08 = 0.04 \, \Omega
$$

Substituting into the power equation:

$$
P = \frac{3 \cdot V^2 \cdot R}{R^2 + X_d^2}
\Rightarrow R \approx 0.14 \, \Omega
$$

This value is obtained through iterative approximation or symbolic solvers.

## 4. Conclusion

The power generated by the synchronous machine (2 MW) in the WinterBind project is dissipated across a **resistive load of approximately 0.14 Ω**, accounting for the internal synchronous reactance. This provides a more accurate and realistic load model for simulations and system design.
